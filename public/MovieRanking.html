<p>This is my number 1 Trilogy of all time, since i was just a little kid,
    I'm a huge fan of fantasy and everything with the vikings era.</p>
<h3> 2. Top Gun</h3>

<p>This Movie is packed with action and all the scenes with fighter jets
    makes it a great movie to watch and rewatch.</p>
 <h3>3. Spirited Away</h3>

<p>Just like Angela, to me this is one of the most beautiful animated Movies that
        I grew up watching
